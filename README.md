## Roadmap

- [ ] Merge sort (recursion, stack frame, array manipulation)

- [ ] two sum (easy Leetcode) in assembly (good for array manipulation)

- [ ] Load file contents into buffer and write into stdout (syscalls and buffering)

- [ ] Do matrix multiplication in assembly (array views, strides, nested arrays...)

## TODO

Take notes on tips and tricks in assembly (nothing formal, just some notes to better understand concepts)
