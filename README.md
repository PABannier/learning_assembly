## Roadmap

- [x] Hello world (syscalls read and write, registers, variables)

- [x] Max of three (basic register manipulations)

- [x] Fibonacci numbers (call to functions, recursion)

- [x] Factorial (recursion, push pop on stack)

- [x] Filled square on output console (buffers, bss)

- [x] Sum of array (pointer arithmetic)

- [ ] Do matrix multiplication in assembly (multi-dimensional arrays, SIMD parallelism)

- [ ] Quick sort (recursion, stack frame, array manipulation)

- [ ] Implement `ls` and `wc`

- [ ] Write Pong

## TODO

Take notes on tips and tricks in assembly (nothing formal, just some notes to better understand concepts)
